#INTRODUCTION

A RESTFUL API (REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) IS AN ARCHITECTURAL STYLE THAT DEFINES A SET OF CONSTRAINTS AND PROPERTIES BASED ON HTTP. IT IS WIDELY USED FOR BUILDING WEB SERVICES THAT ARE SCALABLE, RELIABLE, AND EASY TO MAINTAIN.

KEY PRINCIPLES OF RESTFUL API

    CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE: THE CLIENT AND SERVER OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY, ALLOWING EACH TO EVOLVE SEPARATELY.

    STATELESSNESS: EACH REQUEST FROM CLIENT TO SERVER MUST CONTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND AND PROCESS THE REQUEST. THE SERVER DOES NOT STORE ANY STATE ABOUT THE CLIENT SESSION.

    CACHEABILITY: RESPONSES MUST DEFINE WHETHER THEY ARE CACHEABLE OR NOT TO PREVENT CLIENTS FROM REUSING STALE OR INAPPROPRIATE DATA.

    UNIFORM INTERFACE: A CONSISTENT INTERFACE BETWEEN CLIENTS AND SERVERS, SIMPLIFYING AND DECOPLING THE ARCHITECTURE.

    LAYERED SYSTEM: THE ARCHITECTURE CAN BE COMPOSED OF LAYERS, EACH WITH A SPECIFIC FUNCTION, WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED OR REPLACED INDEPENDENTLY.

    CODE ON DEMAND (OPTIONAL): SERVERS CAN EXTEND CLIENT FUNCTIONALITY BY TRANSFERRING EXECUTABLE CODE.
